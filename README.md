# Polymarket Bot B — V13 Evidence-Constrained Behavioral Replica

Paper-only behavioral research engine. It does **not** place live orders and does not read/copy the reference trader's private activity.

## What changed in V13

V13 removes several unsupported strategy assumptions from the previous branch:

- No synthetic composite alpha score.
- No arbitrary `+2.5c`/`35c` momentum or state-reset thresholds.
- No synthetic "remaining target" capital ladder.
- No arbitrary 1.02/1.05/1.10 entry multipliers.
- No 2-second minimum enforced as trader behavior.
- Entry size is conditioned on price band + observed entry-state medians.
- Side persistence is retained as a preference because ~89.3% of consecutive same-market pairs stayed on the same side.
- The measured weakness/strength gradient is used only as an empirical directional likelihood.
- The final 60-second cutoff remains hard because violations were ~0.04%.
- Research capture defaults to 1-second snapshots and retains a real time-based 60-second history.
- Research records explicit trade-candidate vs non-trade observations plus depth imbalance and movement features.

## Evidence boundary

The following remain **UNKNOWN** and are not hardcoded:

- the reference trader's exact private trigger;
- whether price movement is causal or consequential;
- exact passive-order placement distance;
- exact side-reset mechanism;
- exact market/asset-specific hidden alpha.

## Railway variables

```text
PAPER_TRADING=true
STARTING_CAPITAL=1000
MAX_MARKET_EXPOSURE=100
MAX_ASSET_EXPOSURE=35
MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE=300
MAX_ORDER_USD=10
MIN_PAPER_FILL_USD=0.10

START_TRADING_SECOND=0
STOP_TRADING_SECOND=240
HARD_CUTOFF_SECONDS=60

MAX_DEPTH_PARTICIPATION=0.25
MIN_BID_DEPTH=1

MIN_TRADE_GAP_SECONDS=0
LOOP_SECONDS=1
REPORT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60

DECISION_SAMPLE_SECONDS=1
ORDERBOOK_SAMPLE_SECONDS=1

DATA_DIR=/app/data
DATA_MAINTENANCE_SECONDS=3600
BURST_GAP_SECONDS=18
FRESH_START=true
```

`MIN_TRADE_GAP_SECONDS` is an infrastructure throttle only. It defaults to `0` so it does not distort the observed ~2-second trader cadence.

## Research files

Permanent:

- `trades.csv`
- `trade_details.csv`
- `markets.csv`
- `resolutions.csv`
- `settlement_details.csv`
- `pnl_1min.csv`
- `regime_1min.csv`
- `paper_state.json`

High-volume:

- `decisions.jsonl`
- `orderbooks.jsonl`

The research stream records both candidate events and non-trade observations. Book snapshots include bid/ask, bid/ask depth, spread, and depth imbalance. Decision records additionally include 1/3/5/10/30-second movement features, entry state, burst position, and time since the previous paper entry.

## Accounting

`paper_ledger.py` remains unchanged from the audited branch. Realized P&L is derived from settlement records and reconciled on load/save.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
pytest -q
python -m py_compile strategy.py bot.py paper_ledger.py market_discovery.py research_logger.py
```

The tests cover fine-band boundaries, entry-state sizing, side persistence, empirical trajectory preference, final-minute cutoff, depth limits, resolution accounting, and research logging.


## V13.1 controlled experiment

V13.1 changes one strategy variable only: the minimum depth gate for CORE and
HIGH is loosened to 1.0 for BTC, ETH, SOL, and BNB. Spread gates, sizing,
trajectory logic, side persistence, cutoff, and accounting are unchanged.
The purpose is to test whether the verified CORE/HIGH starvation was caused
by the regime-scaled depth gate. If CORE/HIGH share does not recover, the
next experiment should change spread only—not both together.
